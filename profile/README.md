# `aowl` a from-scratch Nimony clone
`.nim / .aowl → aowlparse → aowlsem* → aowlhexer* → { aowlc → C · aowljs → JS · aowli → interpret }`
<br>
<br>
A rewrite of the entire [Nimony](https://github.com/nim-lang/nimony) ecosystem
* parser, semantic checker, lowering
* interpreter and runtime
* standard library
* LSP, MCP, vscode, claude plugin
* code fix suggestions, formatter, obfuscator
* *and much, much, more...*

<br>

translates to:
* C
* faithful *and* native JavaScript & TypeScript
* Python

<br><br>
*— all self-hosted, written in itself*


<br>

Between the frontend stages we use [AIF, which is NIF](https://aoughwl.github.io/docs/aif), byte for byte, so ***any part you find here is compatabile with Nim or Nimony.***


<sub>*The big projects are private for now, but the docs are public and **anything private is yours if you just ask** — message me on Discord (**timbuktu_guy**) and I'll add you, no hoops. The playground moves onto the new sem + hexing shortly.*</sub>

## 017 — 2026-07-23

**Rebuilt the [net stack](https://aoughwl.github.io/docs/net-stack) around a single-threaded async reactor:** one OS thread, `epoll`, passive-proc coroutines, no `std` async or thread pool.

* HTTP/1.1: keep-alive, chunked, 300/300 concurrent
* WebSocket: masking, frame/control validation, fragmentation, incremental UTF-8, close validation, `permessage-deflate`; 19/19 conformance, 160/160 echo
* HTTP/3: ngtcp2 + nghttp3 + GnuTLS behind a small pull API; 20 QUIC clients, one thread, ASan/LSan clean
* RFC 9221 datagrams + [WebTransport](https://aoughwl.github.io/docs/net-stack/reactor) datagrams over H3; streams remain

Created **[aowljson](https://aoughwl.github.io/docs/aowljson)**: reusable JSON values, error-as-value parsing, serializer, builders, `v{"key"}`, `v.at(i)`.

Created **[aowlmcp](https://aoughwl.github.io/docs/aowlmcp)**: transport-independent MCP dispatch over stdio, HTTP, and HTTP/3. Tests: 13/13, 6/6, 4/4. Includes compile diagnostics and NIF outlines through [aowlcode](https://aoughwl.github.io/docs/aowlcode).

**aowli became an actual runtime:** flat memory, casts, `copyMem`, allocation, unchecked arrays, fd-backed file I/O, env access, ownership hooks, refcounted `ref` objects, and fail-fast unsupported stdlib calls. It now runs about **92% of compiler-buildable programs**, with no known silent wrong-result cases. Remaining: some OS/VM gaps, threads, async.

## 016 — 2026-07-22

Released **[aowli-release](https://github.com/aoughwl/aowli-release) [v0.1.0](https://github.com/aoughwl/aowli-release/releases/tag/v0.1.0)** with:

* `aowli-interp`: run typed NIF, optional call-tree trace
* `aowli-dbg`: batch breakpoints and structured frame dumps
* stripped binaries, fail-closed licence gate, SHA256, VirusTotal links
* no source paths or internal proc/type names

Updated **[aowlcode](https://aoughwl.github.io/docs/aowlcode)** with trace/debug tools, `/land`, Haiku appliers, and parallel edit application.

## 015 2026-07-21 - Tuesday, July 21th 2026
I found some tokens.

## 014 2026-07-20 - Monday, July 20th 2026
I ran out of tokens.<br><br>

Shotout to the fellow Nim'er who created this:  [3code](https://3code.capocasa.dev/), check it out !    (I don't endorse it nor do I agree with it)

## 013 2026-07-19 - Sunday, July 19th 2026

More **aowlsem** — the whole day is a generics push. The semchecker now instantiates and preserves generic constructs end to end: typevar calls and signatures, generic object applications with substituted field types and attached hooks, generic array bounds and range iterators, generic seq index reads, `var` forwarding through generic params, late-bound generic hook calls, and quoted generic operators. Around it: `out` parameter type resolution, `sink`/`source` normalization, typed pointer comparisons lowered to magics, unchecked-pointer index assignments wrapped, `requires` pragma expression checking, and `threadvar` globals emitted. Steady, surgical commits — aowlsem is now **past 340 total commits** since Tuesday.

## 012 2026-07-18 - Saturday, July 18th 2026

**The biggest day yet for [aowlsem](https://aoughwl.github.io/docs/aowlsem)** — 126 commits landing the clean-room semchecker's core. It now passes **397/397 corpus fixtures byte-exact** against the nimony oracle, and — the milestone — it does a **complete zero-diagnostic traversal of the full `std/system`**: the whole `system.nim` plus its included `std/system/*.nim` set, ~6,383 lines, semcheck with **0 errors and 0 log lines**. Full-system parity against nimony's own output is down to ~33k canonical diff lines from an earliest baseline of ~62k — a **46.5% reduction**, with the first mismatch now a third of the way into the semantic output.

Under that headline: the magic table (arithmetic / comparison / set / pointer magics), `varargs[T]` params with call-site collection, membership (`x in coll`) generalized across seq/array/string, seq slicing and `s[a..b]`, `for (a, b) in …` tuple destructuring, `^k` backwards indexing, `countdown` typevar inference, concept declarations, lifetime-hook attachment, and `ptr UncheckedArray[T]` indexing. aowlsem also grows **diagnostics that go beyond nimony** — E0205 self-comparison, E0206 unsigned-compared-to-zero, E0207 empty-loop-range, E0208 tuple-index-out-of-bounds, E0209 shift-amount-out-of-range. *(source private for now; docs public, access on request)*

**We also stood up the whole distribution story — private components, public binaries.** The plan is simple: anything that stays source-private, we still ship to *everyone* — obfuscated, inside a stripped binary.

- **[obfuscate](https://github.com/aoughwl/obfuscate)** was reworked to be **IR-only**. It operates entirely on the compiler's own NIF/AIF token tree, never on source text, so it *inherently* can't corrupt runtime data — strings, chars and comments are their own token kinds and are never touched. Its `obfnif` pass renames every declared symbol to an opaque token (by spelling on parsed NIF, symbol-precise on typed NIF) and weaves in behaviour-preserving control flow, then the result re-feeds the pipeline and behaves identically.
- **[aowl-release](https://github.com/aoughwl/aowl-release)** is the hardening harness — a `build-release.sh` that wraps each component's *own* build and layers source obfuscation → a fail-closed licence/version gate → NIF control-flow injection → `--strip-all` (drops the symbol table decompilers love). The gate refuses to run an expired build; there's no risky client-side kill-switch.
- **Five `-release` repos** now exist as the public homes for the currently-private stages — **aowlsem-release**, **aowli-release**, **aowlts-release**, **aowlpy-release**, **aowlweb-release**. Source stays private; the obfuscated, gated, stripped binaries land here shortly so anyone can *run* the full stack.

**And [aowlup](https://github.com/aoughwl/aowlup) — `rustup` for the aowl/nimony stack.** It installs, versions, and *selects* the pipeline: every slot has interchangeable **variants** (parser `aowlparser`|`nifler`, sem `aowlsem`|`nimsem`, hexer `aowlhexer`|`hexer`, plus backends and tooling), grouped into one-command **profiles** (`aowl` = all ours, `nimony` = all theirs, `hybrid` = the driver default), each pinned to a git **version** with a GitHub update check (it doubles as a nimony version manager). [aowlmony](https://github.com/aoughwl/aowlmony) then compiles against whatever aowlup has selected — exactly the **rustup : cargo** split. The `-release` binaries plug straight into this: aowlup is how you'll pull, pin, and select them, and `aowlup +nimony` gives one-shot toolchain overrides.

And the playground grew a semantics choice. **aowlsem now runs in the browser** — you can pick **aowl semantics** instead of the default nim semantics when type-checking, right in the playground. It's marked **experimental**: real and checking a substantial slice today, but not the full stdlib or generics yet, so it grows from here. **aowlsuggest moved into the playground too** — its quick-fix / lint layer now runs client-side over the parser's diagnostics, so fix-its surface as you edit — and **aowlparser got another update**, with the latest parser bundle now shipping in the playground.

## 011 2026-07-17 - Friday, July 17th 2026

A heavy day on the front and middle of the pipeline.

**[aowlparser](https://aoughwl.github.io/docs/aowlparser)** — reached **full 310/310 structural parity** with the upstream Nim standard library: the entire stdlib round-trips. Shipped a real **`check` lint mode** — grammar-level error detection with fix-its and source-ordered diagnostics: assignment `=` where `==` was meant, a `for` missing its `in`, identifier-expected on `let`/`const`, and more. Fixed three parser **hangs** (infinite recursion) and hardened the lexer — UTF-8 identifiers, BOM stripping, custom numeric literals (`N'big`), parenthesized proc literals, term-rewriting template patterns.

**aowlsem** — a big step toward a true drop-in: an **auto-import system** that pulls in `system` and the module's own imports with no manual flags, real **`include`** splicing, `when not defined(...)` folding, definite-assignment that honours `noinit`/`threadvar`/`importc`, `typedesc` modelled as a type, templates as an overload set, accent-quoted/operator routine names, and the first **value-object ARC hook synthesis** — the foundation for `Table`. *(source private for now; docs public, access on request)*

**[aowli](https://aoughwl.github.io/aowli)** — the interpreter/VM now reads the shared **[aowlhl](https://aoughwl.github.io/docs/aowlhl)** HL-IR layer (`hlload` / `hlclassify` / `hlwalk`) instead of its own tree-walk, and gained **dynamic method dispatch** with field write-through for `ptr`/`var` receivers, closures with nested capture, and UTF-8 `add(string, Rune)`. With this, **aowli is feature-complete: it reproduces 100% of the runnable test corpus byte-for-byte** against nimony's own compile-and-run, on both engines (tree-walker and bytecode VM).

**aowlhl is now the shared high-level IR** — one Nim→HL-IR reader that both `aowli` and `aowljs` consume, so the interpreter and the JavaScript backend classify and walk the same skeleton. One lowering, many emitters.

**The docs site got a ground-up rebuild.** Migrated **[aoughwl.github.io](https://aoughwl.github.io)** off Jekyll / just-the-docs onto **VitePress** — it's now a single-page app with instant client-side navigation (no full reloads), a collapsible nested sidebar, a near-black dark theme, local search, and self-hosted fonts (no font or page flash). It deploys through a GitHub Actions workflow instead of Jekyll, and the in-browser [playground](https://aoughwl.github.io/playground/) is preserved byte-identically.

The nav is region-grouped — Overview / Pipeline / Emitters / Tools / Libraries — and every pipeline, emitter, and tool row carries a small right-aligned "↗" straight to that project's GitHub repo. A floating theme toggle sits in the corner, and GitHub · Discord · Support links live in the top bar.

## 010 2026-07-16 - Thursday, July 16th 2026

Repositioned: **aoughwl is a ground-up Nimony toolchain.** Wrote the interop contract — **[AIF ≡ NIF](https://aoughwl.github.io/docs/aif)**, byte-for-byte, so any Nim/Nimony program behaves identically. Renamed the compiler stages **`aif* → aowl*`** (aowlparse / aowlsem / aowlhexer / aowlc / aowljs / aowli / aowlmony) — `aif` now names the **format** only — and **`nim-code → aowl-code`**. Reworked the docs into two homes — **Documentation** (terse reference) and **Engineering Notes** (opinionated writeups) — collapsed the changelog into a single **Changes** record, and normalized every repo description + topics across the org. `aowlsem` and `aowlhexer` stay private for now (docs public, access on request); the playground moves onto the new sem + hexing shortly.

## 001 ‎2026-07-07 -  Tuesday, July 7th, 2026
Today starts the official **aoughwl/nimony fork**.<br>
This is now the main place my Nimony work will go:
* features
* bug fixes
* more opinionated, dynamic, and substantial stdlib

We also shipped **aoughwl/nimony-lsp** and **aoughwl/nim-code**:
* `nimony-lsp` is the language-server side
* `nim-code` is a Claude Code plugin and MCP server focused on reducing token usage with Nim and Nimony

**Effective indefinitely,  the Nimony JavaScript/TypeScript/WASM/Python backend work is private.**<br>
For interested parties: the JavaScript and WebAssembly backends are ~complete and remain true to the original vision.<br>
I will gladly and promptly add anyone who wants access, but you will need to reach out to me directly over Discord (timbuktu_guy)
